Feedback for GitHub Actions Quickstart:
- I think the screenshots in this document may be slightly outdated. At step 4 of "Creating your first workflow", the screenshot regarding the "Propose new file" appears on the right (rather than left) as "Propose changes." Additionally, hitting this button alone did not start a pull request as expected from the document. Instead, I had to initiate a pull request using a separate button from another prompt dialog. Although this is a minor suggestion, I feel that a newcomer would greatly benefit from the added clarity of updated screenshots. Thanks!
